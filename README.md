## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

-   **Backend:** Python with **Flask** for the web server and API, and **Flask-SocketIO** for real-time WebSocket communication.
-   **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for logic, **MediaPipe** for pose detection, and **Socket.IO** client for real-time updates.
-   **Voice & AI:**
    -   **`pvporcupine`** for wake word detection.
    -   **`SpeechRecognition`** for command transcription.
    -   **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech** for audio responses.
    -   **OpenAI GPT** for conversational AI.
-   **Data & Services:**

## üéØ Usage

The primary way to interact with the mirror is through voice commands.

1.  **Activation:** The mirror is activated by saying the wake word: **"Hey Adonis"**.
2.  **Facial Recognition:** After activation, it will use the camera to recognize the user and load their profile.
3.  **Commands:** Once a user is logged in, you can issue commands like:
    -   *"What's the weather?"*
    -   *"Give me the news."*
    -   *"Do I have any plans today?"*
    -   *"Add an event called meeting tomorrow at 3 PM."*
    -   *"I want to try on a black shirt."*
    -   *"Tell me a joke."* (for the AI assistant)

You can also interrupt the assistant at any time by saying **"Stop"**.
