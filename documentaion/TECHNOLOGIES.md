## Backend Technologies

The backend is the server-side core of the application, responsible for logic, data processing, and serving information to the user interface.

### 1. Python

-   **What it is:** A high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its clear syntax and extensive ecosystem of libraries.
-   **How we used it:** Python is the foundation of the entire backend. All backend services, the web server, and the core application logic are written in Python.
-   **Why we chose it:**
    -   **Rich AI/ML Ecosystem:** Python is the industry standard for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, providing access to essential libraries like `face_recognition`, `SpeechRecognition`, and `OpenAI`.
    -   **Excellent Web Frameworks:** It supports powerful and easy-to-use web frameworks like Flask.
    -   **Simplicity and Readability:** Its clean syntax makes the code easier to write, debug, and maintain, which is ideal for a complex project like this.

### 2. Flask

-   **What it is:** A lightweight "micro" web framework for Python. It provides the essentials for building web applications without imposing a rigid structure.
-   **How we used it:** Flask is used to run the web server, define the API endpoints (e.g., `/weather`, `/news`, `/calendar`), and render the main HTML interface.
-   **Why we chose it:**
    -   **Simplicity and Flexibility:** As a micro-framework, Flask is not bloated with features we don't need. It allows us to build a custom backend tailored to our specific requirements.
    -   **Modularity:** Its extension-based design allowed us to easily integrate other technologies like `Flask-SocketIO` for real-time communication and `Flask-Caching` for performance.
    -   **Perfect for this Project:** For an application that primarily serves data through an API and has a single main interface, Flask is a more efficient and straightforward choice than a larger, more opinionated framework like Django.

### 3. Flask-SocketIO

-   **What it is:** An extension for Flask that enables real-time, bi-directional communication between the server and the client using the WebSocket protocol.
-   **How we used it:** It is the communication backbone for all real-time interactions. We use it to:
    -   Push audio responses from the server to the client (`play_audio`).
    -   Notify the backend when audio has finished playing (`audio_finished`).
    -   Instantly display or hide the virtual try-on interface (`trigger_tryon`, `hide_tryon`).
    -   Update the UI to show when the assistant is listening (`start_listening`).
-   **Why we chose it:**
    -   **Real-Time Experience:** Standard HTTP requests are not suitable for a dynamic interface where the server needs to push information to the client instantly. WebSockets are essential for the responsive, interactive feel of the mirror.
    -   **Seamless Integration:** It integrates perfectly with our Flask backend, making the implementation of real-time features clean and manageable.

## Frontend Technologies

The frontend is the user-facing part of the application that runs in the web browser.

### 1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

-   **What they are:** The three core technologies for building web pages. HTML provides the structure, CSS handles the styling, and JavaScript enables interactivity.
-   **How we used them:**
    -   **HTML:** To define the layout of all the widgets and containers on the screen.
    -   **CSS:** To style the entire interface, creating the "frosted glass" effect for widgets, the dynamic background that changes with the time of day, and all animations.
    -   **JavaScript:** For all client-side logic, including fetching data from the backend APIs, updating the widgets, managing the virtual try-on, and handling WebSocket communication.
-   **Why we chose them:** They are the fundamental and universal languages of the web. There are no alternatives for building a web-based user interface from the ground up.

### 2. MediaPipe Pose

-   **What it is:** A high-fidelity, cross-platform library from Google for real-time pose estimation.
-   **How we used it:** It runs directly in the browser, processing the user's webcam feed to detect the position and orientation of their body landmarks (shoulders, hips, etc.). The coordinates of these landmarks are then used to accurately position and scale the clothing overlay in the virtual try-on feature.
-   **Why we chose it:**
    -   **Performance:** It is highly optimized to run smoothly in real-time on standard hardware, directly within the browser, which avoids the need for expensive server-side video processing.
    -   **Accuracy:** It provides high-quality landmark detection, which is crucial for making the virtual try-on feel realistic.
    -   **On-Device ML:** It keeps user video data on the client side, which is better for privacy and reduces network latency.

## Voice and AI Technologies

These technologies give the smart mirror its intelligence and voice capabilities.

### 1. Picovoice Porcupine (`pvporcupine`)

-   **What it is:** A highly accurate and lightweight wake word detection engine.
-   **How we used it:** It runs continuously in a background thread on the backend, listening to the microphone input for the custom wake word "Hey Adonis" without needing to stream audio to the cloud.
-   **Why we chose it:**
    -   **Efficiency and Privacy:** It is extremely resource-efficient, making it ideal for always-on applications. Because it runs entirely on-device, no audio is sent over the network until after the wake word is detected, ensuring user privacy.
    -   **Accuracy:** It offers very high accuracy in detecting the wake word while having a very low false-positive rate.

### 2. SpeechRecognition Library

-   **What it is:** A Python library that acts as a wrapper for various speech-to-text APIs.
-   **How we used it:** After Porcupine detects the wake word, we use this library to capture the user's full command from the microphone and send it to the **Google Web Speech API** for transcription.
-   **Why we chose it:**
    -   **Flexibility:** It supports multiple speech recognition engines, making it easy to switch providers if needed.
    -   **High-Quality Free Tier:** The Google Web Speech API it uses provides highly accurate transcription for free, making it a cost-effective choice for a personal project.

### 3. Google Cloud Text-to-Speech

-   **What it is:** A cloud service that converts text into natural-sounding human speech.
-   **How we used it:** Whenever the assistant needs to respond, we send the text response to this API. It returns an MP3 audio file, which we then play on the frontend.
-   **Why we chose it:**
    -   **Voice Quality:** It provides access to Google's high-fidelity "WaveNet" voices, which are significantly more natural and human-sounding than standard synthesized voices. This greatly enhances the user experience.

### 4. OpenAI API (GPT Models)

-   **What it is:** An API that provides access to OpenAI's powerful language models.
-   **How we used it:** It serves as the "brain" for general conversation. If a user's command does not match a pre-defined function (like "weather" or "news"), the command is sent to a GPT model to generate an intelligent, conversational response. It is also used for creative tasks like personal recommendations.
-   **Why we chose it:**
    -   **State-of-the-Art NLU:** It has world-class Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities, allowing the mirror to handle a vast range of topics and questions, making it feel much more intelligent and useful.
    -   **Versatility:** It can handle everything from answering factual questions to telling jokes, which makes the mirror a more engaging and helpful assistant.

### 5. `face_recognition` Library

-   **What it is:** A Python library built on dlib for simple and powerful facial recognition.
-   **How we used it:** To identify users. When a face is detected, the library creates a numerical encoding of the facial features. This encoding is then compared against a stored database of known users to find a match. This is how the mirror "logs in" a user and loads their profile.
-   **Why we chose it:**
    -   **Simplicity:** It makes implementing complex facial recognition incredibly straightforward. It abstracts away the underlying machine learning models into a very easy-to-use API.
    -   **Effectiveness:** It is highly effective for person identification in controlled environments like a smart mirror setup.

## Data and Image Processing

### 1. `rembg`

-   **What it is:** A Python tool specifically designed to remove the background from images.
-   **How we used it:** It is a critical component of the virtual try-on pipeline. When a clothing item is fetched from the API, we pass its image to `rembg` to get a version with a transparent background, which can then be cleanly overlaid on the user's video feed.
-   **Why we chose it:** It is a specialized tool that does one job very well. This is far more practical than attempting to build a complex background-removal model from scratch.

### 2. Pillow

-   **What it is:** The Python Imaging Library (PIL) Fork, an essential library for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
-   **How we used it:** It's used under the hood by `rembg` and our own `image_utils.py` to handle all image-related operations, such as opening image data from a web request and saving the processed file to disk.
-   **Why we chose it:** It is the de-facto standard for image processing in Python and a necessary dependency for any project that works with images.
